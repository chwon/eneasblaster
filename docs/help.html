	<h1>Eneas Blaster Help</h1>
	
	Eneas Blaster (EB) is an easy-to-use app that allows you to memorize and play your favourite songs. EB connects to Spotify in the background to play music. For this reason, EB requires the Spotify app to be installed and signed-in to function properly.
	
	
	<h2>Setup</h2>
	
	<div class="container">
		<div class="text">
			When EB is launched for the first time, it requests your permission to interact with the Spotify app on your behalf. You need to confirm this request in order to use EB.
			<br>
			EB requires your permit to access Spotify on your behalf exclusively for its stated functionality. EB does not use or collect data from you for any other purposes. None of your data from interactions with your Spotify account is transferred to any EB servers.
			<br>
			The screen that asks for your permission is likely to resemble the one that you can see on the right hand side. Click on "Agree" in order to give your permission and to use EB.

	<h2>Basic operation</h2>
	
	<div class="container">
		<div class="text">
			Using Eneas Blaster is extremely simple. Its main screen consists of one button for each track from the current playlist. Pressing a button will immediately start playback of that song.
	
			<br>
	
			The name of the current track is shown in the title bar right under the the app name, along with an indicator showing if the song is currently playing (▶), or paused (⏸). To toggle between playback and pause, just click on the round EB logo in the upper left corner of the screen.
	
			<br>
	
			When a song is played, its cover artwork is shown in the background. The standard EB background picture is shown when no song is playing.

	<h2>Menu items</h2>
	
	<div class="container">
		<div class="text">
			All further EB functionality can be accessed via the options menu, which pops up when you press the three dots in the upper right corner of the screen.
			
				
			<h3>Use internal playlist</h3>
	
			Toggle between EB's internal playlist and an external playlist.
	
			<br>
	
			Eneas Blaster uses two principal playlists - an internal playlist, which is the default, and an optional external playlist stored in a file on your device. If no external playlist has been chosen before, the menu item is greyed out.
	
			<h3>Choose playlist file</h3>
	
			Select a previously exported playlist or manually created playlist file as external playlist.
	
			<h3>Export internal playlist</h3>
	
			Export the internal playlist as a file on your device.
	
			<br>
	
			You can use the exported file as an external playlist on any device running Eneas Blaster.
